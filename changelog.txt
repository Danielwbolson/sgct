2013-01-17 SGCT ver 1.1.0
---------------------------

* Not allocating right texture if stereo is not used
* Started testing stereoscopic fisheye (Not working yet)

* Added option to generate depth buffer textures from FBO

2013-01-18 SGCT ver 1.1.0
---------------------------
* Implemented off-axis fisheye stereo
* Moved apect ratio handling to window class
* Resolved wireframe rendering problem for right eye in stereo fisheye

2013-02-09 SGCT ver 1.1.1 - 1.1.2
---------------------------
* Modified screenshot handling, now multithreaded using PBOs
* Updated zlib (zlib 1.2.7) and libpng (lpng 1.5.14) to resolve memory leaking problems
* Removed to include opengl32.lib and glu32.lib for visual studio libs
* Improved image class. Better memory handling.
* Removed some visual studio warning by moving order of includes

2013-02-14 SGCT ver 1.1.3
---------------------------
* Added support for vertical interlaced stereo for polirized LCD screens
* Added more accurate frame sync
* Added cluster barrier - All nodes wait until all are connected

2013-02-14 SGCT ver 1.2.0
---------------------------
* Forcing full frame sync
* Changing frame number to unsigned int from long long for better compability with other software (OSG)
* Timing is now more accurate for draw and sync
* Added setExitKey function to engine
* Changed socket buffer size for cluster nodes to 4096 instead of default 8192 for faster communications
* TextureManager: getTextureByIndex renamed to getTextureByHandle for not confusing with openGL texture indexes
* Added protection against culling so that the FBO renderquad don't disapear if culling is active
* Added TGA capture support for compability with 7th sense Delta (Delta can playback TGA files as movies)
* Improved FXAA quality

2013-02-25 SGCT ver 1.3.0
---------------------------
* Removed possibility to render depth buffers from sgct, the user can do that in code
* Added extra render pass if FXAA is used to be able to save effects/AA to file

2013-05-01 SGCT ver 1.4.0
---------------------------
* Added Mutex manager
* Redesigned SharedData to use mutex protected SharedDataTypes to prevent data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads
* Changed get matrix function names for viewport and Engine to more correct terms for better compability with openGL 3 & 4. Previously the projection matrix did return projection * view matrix which was incorrect.

2013-05-09 SGCT ver 1.4.1
---------------------------
* Resolved FBO bugs while using MSAA in fisheyemode
* Added support to use MSAA + FXAA in fisheye rendering
