Simple Graphics Cluster Toolkit (
SGCT) is a free static cross-platform C++ library for developing immersive OpenGL applications that can run on a cluster of computers. 
SGCT is designed to be as simple as possible for the developer and is 
well suited for rapid prototyping of immersive stereoscopic virtual reality (VR) applications. 
SGCT can also be used to create planetarium/dome content and can generate fisheye projections.
