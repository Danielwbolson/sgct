# sgct
Simple Graphics Cluster Toolkit
SGCT is a free static cross-platform C++ library for developing OpenGL applications that are synchronized across a cluster of image generating computers (IGs). SGCT is designed to be as simple as possible for the developer and is well suited for rapid prototyping of immersive virtual reality (VR) applications. SGCT can also be used to create planetarium/dome content and can generate fisheye projections. Its also possible to render to file to create extreeme hi-resolution stereoscopic 3D movies.
